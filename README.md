# synchronome

> A React Native app for playing live music over video conferencing.

## how it works

1. Set a beat
2. Invite other people with your room code
3. Play music to the beat, which will keep everyone exactly in sync

## limitations

Live audio will have latency, so everyone will have to play based on the metronome
instead of what they hear from other people. So, no jam sessions, but you can play a 
pre-arranged piece live, and your audience will hear it correctly.
